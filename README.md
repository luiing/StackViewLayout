# android-pile-layout
An abnormal horizontal ListView-like pile layout.

### captured images
The following pictures were captured earlier. Since the source code and the outputted-apk have changed some params, you will have a different UI when you directly run the code or install the apk file. Hope there has no confusions later.  <br><br>
<img src="capture/capture1.gif" width="360" height="645"/> <img src="capture/capture2.gif" width="360" height="645"/> 

### design
Recently I have seen this kind of UI design, and at the first sight I was trying to implement it by using RecyclerView's LayoutManager. Unfortunately, I am unable to contrust a clear Math model while sliding the PileView. After several tries, I gave up LayoutManager, and find another way for this implementation. If you make LayoutManager works well for this UI design, please tell me later.

### how to use
1. declare PileLayout in your xml file
``` xml
<com.stone.pile.libs.PileLayout
        android:id="@+id/pileLayout"
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
        android:paddingBottom="5dp"
        android:paddingTop="5dp"
        pile:displayCount="1.5"
        pile:interval="10dp"
        pile:scaleStep="0.22"
        pile:widthHeightRate="1.22" />
```
Meanwhile, pileLayout is able to be customized by these 4 params:

|name|format|description|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| interval | dimension |items-margin each other
| sizeRatio | float |each item's height/witdth
| scaleStep | float |size scale step when needed
| displayCount | float |number of items that may display

2. in Java files:
``` java
pileLayout = (PileLayout) findViewById(R.id.pileLayout);
pileLayout.setAdapter(new PileLayout.Adapter() {
            @Override
            public int getLayoutId() {
                // item's layout resource id
                return R.layout.item_layout;
            }

            @Override
            public void bindView(View view, int position) {
                ViewHolder viewHolder = (ViewHolder) view.getTag();
                if (viewHolder == null) {
                    viewHolder = new ViewHolder();
                    viewHolder.imageView = (ImageView) view.findViewById(R.id.imageView);
                    view.setTag(viewHolder);
                }
                // recycled view bind new position
            }

            @Override
            public int getItemCount() {
                // item count
                return dataList.size();
            }

            @Override
            public void displaying(int position) {
                // right displaying the left biggest itemView's position 
            }

            @Override
            public void onItemClick(View view, int position) {
                // on item click
            }
});
```
